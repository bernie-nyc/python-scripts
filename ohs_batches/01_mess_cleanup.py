==============================================================
Delete .ini and .db files from current folder and subfolders
==============================================================

What this script does
---------------------
1. Looks at the folder where you run the script.
2. Searches through every subfolder inside it.
3. Finds all files that end with ".ini" or ".db".
4. Counts how many such files exist.
5. Announces how many it will delete.
6. Deletes them one by one.
7. While deleting, shows progress in the form: [x/N] Deleted: filename
   where x is the number deleted so far and N is the total number.

Important notes
---------------
- Files will be permanently deleted. They will not go to the Recycle Bin.
- You can stop the script at any time by pressing CTRL+C.
- If a file cannot be deleted (for example, it is in use), the script will
  tell you that it failed for that file and then move on.
