# rename_students_dvf_guarded.py
# Purpose:
#   Rename student folders so each folder keeps its 8-digit ID and appends the student's name.
#   Example output name: "12304570 - McNally, Morgan"
#
# Problem this solves:
#   Student names can appear in many messy ways:
#     - In file names like "McNally, Morgan.pdf" or "Morgan McNally.jpg"
#     - Inside PDFs, especially on "Data Verification Forms" that show "Student Name: Last, First"
#   We only want real student names - not labels like "Student Name, Signature" or "Contact Person's Name".
#
# How it works in plain steps:
#   1) Walk each child folder under ROOT that looks like 8 digits.
#   2) Try to find a reliable "Last, First" name from filenames first.
#   3) If not found, read up to the first few pages of any PDFs and look for:
#        - DVF line: "Student Name: Last, First" - special, high trust
#        - Other name-like patterns, but reject surrounding admin text
#   4) Pick the best candidate with a simple score system and rename the folder.
#
# Requirements:
#   pip install PyPDF2
#
# Important toggles:
#   - Set DRY_RUN = True to preview changes without renaming anything.
#   - Set DRY_RUN = False to actually rename folders.

# ROOT is the parent folder that contains many subfolders named with 8 digits.
